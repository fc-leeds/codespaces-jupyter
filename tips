From the CS terminal, run code /workspaces/foo

A new tab will open up with /workspaces/foo as the root (sometimes you have to run it twice)

code $HOME or code ~ works too

code *.md also works

If you get a popup in your original window, just click cancel.

On our current project, we clone 8 different repos to /workspaces and change between them often. It works really well (almost all the time - an occasional "wierd" behavior)
